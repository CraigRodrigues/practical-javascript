### Practical Javascript
###### Here is where I will keep all of my work for the Practical Javascript course.
---
* It is a free beginner JS course taught by [Gordon Zhu](https://twitter.com/gordon_zhu)
* You can find it here: [www.watchandcode.com](https://watchandcode.com/])
* We will slowly be creating a To-do list app. It should continue to grow and get more complex as I progress.
